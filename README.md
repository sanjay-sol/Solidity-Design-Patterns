## Introduction
This project demonstrates the Solidity Diamond Pattern, a design pattern that allows for modular and upgradable smart contracts. The Diamond Pattern is used to split a contract into multiple facets, each handling specific functionalities, while a central Diamond contract delegates calls to these facets.

## Diamond Proxy Pattern Overview
The Diamond Pattern, also known as the Diamond Proxy Pattern, is a way to manage complex smart contracts in a modular and upgradeable manner. This pattern allows you to:

- **Modularize Functionality**: Split a contract's functionality into multiple facets, each implemented in separate contracts.
- **Upgrade Functionality**: Update or replace facets without altering the core Diamond contract, making the system flexible and scalable.

### Key Components
1. **Diamond Contract**: Central contract that manages function dispatching and facet updates.
2. **Facets**: Separate contracts implementing specific functionalities. Each facet can be upgraded independently.
3. **Function Selectors**: Used to determine which facet handles a particular function call. 

### How It Works
1. **Function Call Delegation**: The Diamond contract uses a fallback function to delegate calls to the appropriate facet based on the function selector (hash of the function signature).
2. **Facet Registration**: Facets are registered with the Diamond contract along with their function selectors. When a function call is made, the Diamond contract looks up the selector to determine which facet should handle the call.
3. **Upgradeability**: New facets can be added or existing ones updated by modifying the facet-to-selector mapping in the Diamond contract.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following structure:

contracts/
  - facets/
    - OwnershipFacet.sol
    - TokenFacet.sol
  - interfaces/
    - IDiamond.sol
    - IOwnershipFacet.sol
    - ITokenFacet.sol
  - Diamond.sol
scripts/
  - deploy.js


### Description of Files

- **Diamond.sol**: The central contract that manages facets and delegates function calls.
- **OwnershipFacet.sol**: A facet handling ownership management functions.
- **TokenFacet.sol**: A facet managing token-related functions.
- **interfaces/**: Contains interfaces defining the functions exposed by the Diamond and facets.
- **deploy.js**: Deployment script using Hardhat to deploy the Diamond contract and facets, and register function selectors.

## Deployment
The deployment script (`deploy.js`) uses Hardhat to:
1. Deploy the Diamond contract.
2. Deploy facets (`OwnershipFacet` and `TokenFacet`).
3. Register the function selectors of each facet with the Diamond contract.

## How It Works
1. **Deployment**: Deploy the Diamond contract and facets. Register the function selectors of each facet in the Diamond contract.
2. **Function Calls**: When a function call is made, the Diamond contract uses the fallback function to delegate the call to the appropriate facet based on the function selector.
3. **Facet Management**: Facets can be updated or replaced by updating the function selector mappings in the Diamond contract.

## Storage Slots
The Diamond Pattern leverages storage slots to manage state efficiently:
- **Diamond Storage**: The Diamond contract uses a mapping to store the address of each facet associated with function selectors.
- **Facet Storage**: Each facet maintains its own state, which is managed independently of other facets.


### How Function Delegation Works
1. **Function Selector Lookup**: Diamond contract looks up the function selector.
2. **Facet Invocation**: Calls the appropriate facet based on the function selector.
